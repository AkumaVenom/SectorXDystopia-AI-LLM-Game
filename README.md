========================================================================

SectorX Dystopia is a cutting-edge game that uses Local/offline Voiced LLM AI for every single NPCs in the game.

SectorX Dystopia is a immersive roleplaying experience where every NPC is real time AI, not scripted. There are no canned dialogue trees, no predictable responses. Every character in the game is a living, thinking digital mind driven by cutting-edge LLM (Large Language Model) technology, running entirely on your own hardware offline.

Using built-in native GPU Based LLM Text generation, Mic voice recognition and text to speech, you have real conversations with AI citizens of Neon City. They respond with their own unique voices, emotions, and thoughts in real time based on the games immersive lore, shaped by who they are and how the world around them evolves.
From lively party clubs to shady underworld fixers and cyborg hackers to weary street vendors, The city breathes through its people.

Set in a sprawling cyberpunk slum metropolis built by Sector X Inc, where the night never ends, Neon City pulses with energy as music echoes from every corner, night clubs illuminate the streets, and towering skyscrapers cast a glowing haze over the urban jungle.
SectorX Dystopia isn’t just a game. It’s a living RPG narrative simulation of a cyberpunk world where the people are as real as the city they live in.
Welcome to Neon City.

🎙️ 100% Local Voice-to-Voice & TTS Interaction

🧠 100% Local AI NPCs: Every character in the game runs on a local LLM, with no server dependency or pre-written scripts.

🌆 To Be A Massive Open World: Explore the gritty, neon-soaked sprawl of a cyberpunk slum metropolis, alive with music, nightlife, and urban chaos.

🕶️ True Emergent Gameplay: No two conversations are the same. NPCs react, remember, and evolve.

SectorX Dystopia is being created with Unreal Engine 5.5 and is a work in progress that is currently in the early alpha stage at the moment.

Currently there is only a small demo map to explore featuring the AI NPCS, Expect a big cyberpunk neon city in the future!
